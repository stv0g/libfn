HARDWARE

All tools have been tested with a chain of ten fnordlicht minis:
http://wiki.lochraster.org/wiki/Fnordlichtmini

The libary has been implemented according to this protocol spec:
https://raw.github.com/fd0/fnordlicht/master/doc/PROTOCOL

To connect the fnordlichts to your computer you need a serial port or an USB to RS232 adapter and a RS232 to TTL level shifter (MAX232).
Connect your CTS line to the interrupt line of the fnordlicht bus to be able to count the devices on the bus.
