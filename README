This is a simple c lib for controlling your fnordlichts.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's written by Steffen Vogel <info@steffenvogel.de> and licenced under GPLv3 or newer.
Please contact me by mail for bug reports or annotations.

The source is including a small cli program and a vu meter to show your audio level on the lights.

To connect the fnordlichts to your computer you need a serial port or an USB to RS232 adapter and a RS232 to TTL level shifter (MAX232).
Connect your CTS line to the interrupt line of the fnordlicht bus to be able to count the devices on the bus.
